# Space Invaders Game
This was my test task to join [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/). The game was written in May of 2017 in Vanilla JS ES6 and using Canvas API.
The development/test/build processes were done with help of Babel, Webpack and Jest.
This is a modified version, rewritten in TypeScript, Webpack/Jest replaced by Vite/Vitest, with additional tools like Prettier, ESLint, Husky, lint-staged, Commitizen added.
The core logic and structure are preserved in their original form.
